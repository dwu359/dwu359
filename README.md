Computer science major by day, developer by night. I love what I do because it allows my creativity to reign.

Hi! I'm Daniel Wu, and I am currently pursuing an undergraduate Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech.
When I'm not on the studying grind or coding random side projects, I love playing tennis with my friends, trying out new cooking recipes, and catching up on the latest scientific trends.
